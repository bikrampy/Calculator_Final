# 🧮 Basic Calculator Web App

This is a simple calculator web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The project is designed as a beginner-friendly exercise for learning front-end development.

## ✨ Features

- Responsive and clean UI
- Perform basic operations: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`
- Supports decimal numbers
- `C` button to clear input
- `=` button to calculate result
- Instant interaction using mouse clicks

## 📁 Project Structure

Calculator_Final/  
├── index.html  
└── README.md

## 🧠 How It Works

- **HTML** builds the structure of the calculator including the input field and buttons.
- **CSS** styles the calculator to center it, add spacing, colors, shadows, and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript** adds interactivity:
  - Detects button clicks
  - Dynamically updates the input display
  - Evaluates expressions using `eval()` (for basic functionality)
  - Handles clearing and equal operations

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
3. Start performing calculations by clicking the buttons.

## ⚠️ Security Note

This calculator uses `eval()` to evaluate user input. While it's fine for local or learning use, **`eval()` can be dangerous** in real-world applications if not properly sanitized. Avoid using it in production apps without validation.

## 🪪 License

This project is free to use and modify for educational or personal use.
